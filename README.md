D# Task Manager Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack task manager application built with the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: React with Vite, Axios, React Router DOM, and Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Golang using Gin-Gonic and MongoDB with CORS enabled
- **Database**: MongoDB

The application allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks.

---

## Features

- Create new tasks
- View a list of all tasks
- Update task details
- Delete tasks
- Simple and responsive UI using Bootstrap

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **Go** (v1.16 or later)
- **MongoDB**

---

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup (Golang)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-backend-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Set environment variables (if required):
   - `DB_URI`: MongoDB connection URI
   - `PORT`: Port number for the backend

4. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:8080` (or the specified port).

### Frontend Setup (React with Vite)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd <your-frontend-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The React app should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or the specified port).

## API Endpoints

### Task Endpoints

- `GET /tasks` - Get all tasks
- `GET /tasks/:id` - Get a task by ID
- `POST /tasks` - Create a new task
- `PUT /tasks/:id` - Update a task by ID
- `DELETE /tasks/:id` - Delete a task by ID

---

## Frontend Structure

### Components

- **TaskView**: Displays the details of a single task.
- **TaskList**: Shows the list of all tasks.
- **TaskCreate**: A form for creating new tasks.
- **TaskUpdate**: A form for updating existing tasks.
- **PageHeader**: Common header for navigation.

### Navigation

- `/` - Task list page
- `/task/:id` - View a single task
- `/create` - Create a new task
- `/update/:id` - Update an existing task

---

## CORS Configuration

The backend is configured to allow CORS to enable communication between the React frontend and the Go backend.

---

## MongoDB Configuration

Ensure MongoDB is running and properly configured. Update the `DB_URI` environment variable as necessary.

---

## Deployment

### Backend Deployment

- Build the Go binary:
  ```bash
  go build -o task-manager
  ```
- Run the binary:
  ```bash
  ./task-manager
  ```

### Frontend Deployment

- Build the React app for production:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- Deploy the contents of the `dist` folder (generated by Vite) to any static site hosting service.
